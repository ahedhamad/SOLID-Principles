##Interface_Segregation##

1.	How does fourth project violate the Interface Segregation Principle?

Interface Bird forces both classes ( Eagle and Penguin) to make an override all behavers, 
with this class the eagle takes a behaver that it does not need (swim), and the Penguin class takes a behaver (fly),
which it does not need.

That is, they violate the principles of Interface Segregation Principle.


2.	Draw class diagram for the new design for fourth project 

3.	Make the required change on the code to remove the Interface Segregation Principle violations.

â€¢	build three interfaces(IFlight, ISwimming, IMolting) for each behaver, 
thus both classes (Eagle and Penguin) implement the interface it needs without forcing them to take a behaver they don't need.
