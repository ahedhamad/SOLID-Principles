###Liskov_Substitution###

1.	How does third project violate the Liskov Substitution Principle?

becouse subclasses(limited Customer) cannot be substitutable for their supper classes(Customer),
this means that when using the customer class the code does not work if the subclass(limited customer) is passed.

That is, they violate the principles of Liskov Substitution Principle.


2.	Draw class diagram for the new design for third project 

3.	Make the required change on the code to remove the Liskov Substitution Principle violations

â€¢	It was avoided by making a class (GeneralCustomer) that contains the three functions,
and both classes (limited Customer) and class (Public Customer) are inherited from it,
then simple changes to the override functions, thus the problem Liskov Substitution was solved
