1.	How does Second project violate the Open-Closed Principle?
 For the calculator class, there are a lot of possible mathematical operations,
 so the getOperationResult() can be added to many mathematical operations,
 It becomes difficult to reuse and maintain it because for each mathematical operations,
 the if-Statement is different, That is, they violate the principles of Open-Closed Principle.

2.	Draw class diagram for the new design for Second project 

3.	Make the required change on the code to remove the Open-Closed Principle violations.

•	Build Interface (IGetOperationResult) and linking it with the Calculator Class through the Aggregation relationship, 
it contains resuls function take the Arraylist numbers, to override it in addition, count, max, min and multiplication classes , 
they are implements for the  interface (IGetOperationResult).

•	With this, many if-statements were break in the same function, 
so modification and maintenance could be done with ease in one class for each operation.
